# pyiron hackathon 2024 
This is for repository for the pyiron hackathon from the 9.-11. Sept. 2024 at the [Max-Planck-Institute for Sustainable Materials](https://www.mpie.de/).

## Topic 
The focus of this hackathon is [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and how functions with clear defined input and output simplify the construction of complex simulation workflows. 
Consequently the goal of the hackathon is that every participant creates a simulation workflow for their research project using this functional programming approach.
